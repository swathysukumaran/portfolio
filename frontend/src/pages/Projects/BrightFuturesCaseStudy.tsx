          Bright Futures Tutoring was a group capstone project completed as part
          of our Project Management course. The objective was to design and
          build a professional, accessible tutoring platform that allows
          students and parents to book sessions with tutors, while supporting
          both in-person and online formats.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          While the project was managed as a team, I was fully responsible for
          the development phase and built the entire application using the MERN
          stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

          The main functionality ‚Äî viewing tutors and booking time slots ‚Äî was
          successfully implemented. Development was done within a tight academic
          timeline, and while all core features are functional, the project has
          room for future refinement in UI polish, theme consistency, and
          feedback mechanisms to create a smoother user flow.
