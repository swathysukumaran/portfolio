          Bright Futures Tutoring was developed as part of a group project for
          our Project Management course at North Island College. The objective
          was to create a functional tutoring platform that allows students to
          browse tutors and book appointments.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          While the project was collaboratively planned, I took complete
          ownership of the development process. I built the entire application
          using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) under strict
          academic time constraints.

        <p className="mb-4">
          The academic timeline gave me only a few weeks to translate the client
          brief into a working web app. I focused on core features: user
          authentication, tutor listings, and a calendar-based booking system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Post-course, I continued refining the app independently to prepare it
          for my portfolio, improving code structure, visual design, and
          deployment stability.

        <p>
          This project helped me grow beyond just implementing features. I had
          to think about user flow, deployment details, and interface polish. It
          taught me the importance of revisiting my own code, improving what‚Äôs
          already working, and making something truly usable.

          Bright Futures started as a college project ‚Äî now it's a real, working
          app I feel confident including in my portfolio.
