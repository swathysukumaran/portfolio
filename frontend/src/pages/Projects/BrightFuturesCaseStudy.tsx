          Bright Futures Tutoring was developed as part of a group project for
          our Project Management course at North Island College. The objective
          was to create a functional tutoring platform that allows students to
          browse tutors and book appointments.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          While the project was collaboratively planned, I took complete
          ownership of the development process. I built the entire application
          using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) under strict
          academic time constraints.

        <p className="mb-4">
          The academic timeline gave me only a few weeks to translate the client
          brief into a working web app. I focused on core features: user
          authentication, tutor listings, and a calendar-based booking system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Post-course, I continued refining the app independently to prepare it
          for my portfolio, improving code structure, visual design, and
          deployment stability.

        <p>
          This project helped me grow beyond just implementing features. I had
          to think about user flow, deployment details, and interface polish. It
          taught me the importance of revisiting my own code, improving what‚Äôs
          already working, and making something truly usable.
