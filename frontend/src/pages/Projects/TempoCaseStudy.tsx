          Tempo began with one simple idea: everyone travels differently ‚Äî even
          to the same place, on the same dates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people travel to relax. Others to explore. Some are with their
          kids, some on solo adventures, and others are attending weddings or
          work trips. The same city can mean totally different things depending
          on who's going and why.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the inspiration behind Tempo, my capstone project ‚Äî and also
          my first experience working with Large Language Models (LLMs).
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to build something that felt personal, flexible, and smart ‚Äî
          something that didn‚Äôt just give you a list of tourist spots, but
          actually listened to what you wanted.

          üß† From Forms to Freedom
        </h2>
        <p>
          Tempo always used AI ‚Äî but in the beginning, I was only scratching the
          surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started with a form-based system. Users could choose things like
          pace, activity level, and travel style. The AI would take those and
          generate an itinerary. It worked, but something felt off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I realized: even the same person doesn't travel the same way
          every time. Your preferences change. A solo trip is different from a
          family trip. A honeymoon is different from a work conference.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had originally planned to store user preferences after onboarding
          and reuse them. But that idea started to break ‚Äî because in real life,
          travel styles change with context.
        </p>
        <p>
          And once I saw what the AI could really understand, I asked myself:
          <em>Why am I limiting the input at all?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          So I removed the onboarding, removed the fixed options, and replaced
          it all with a single smart text box ‚Äî or voice input.
        </p>
        <p>Now, users can simply say:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-5 my-2">
          <li>
            ‚ÄúKeep it budget-friendly but surprise me with one luxury activity,‚Äù
          </li>
          <li>‚ÄúNothing on Day 2 ‚Äî I‚Äôll be attending a wedding.‚Äù</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No rigid fields. Just human input. And the AI understands.</p>
        <p>
          That moment ‚Äî when I moved away from structured inputs and let people
          speak freely ‚Äî is when Tempo became something real.

          üß© Major Challenges (and What I Learned)
        </h2>
        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">ü§ñ Inconsistent AI Responses</h3>
        <p>
          Since this was my first time working with LLMs, I faced a lot of
          issues:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-5 mb-2">
          <li>Random text before/after the JSON</li>
          <li>Broken or incomplete responses</li>
          <li>The AI sometimes changed the data structure</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>My solution:</strong> I switched to using Gemini‚Äôs recommended
          structured output format and sent the exact JSON schema in the prompt.
          I also added a retry mechanism in case the response was malformed.
          These changes made Tempo far more stable ‚Äî especially during demos and
          real-time use.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mt-6">üó£Ô∏è Voice-to-Text Integration</h3>
        <p>
          I explored a few options, including lightweight React libraries. They
          worked, but the accuracy wasn‚Äôt good enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          I eventually chose Google Cloud Speech-to-Text because of its
          reliability and room for future enhancements ‚Äî like language
          translation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, users can literally talk to the app to plan or modify their trip.

          üå± What I Learned
        </h2>
        <p>Tempo taught me a lot more than how to build a full-stack app.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-5 mb-2">
          <li>
            I learned how to structure prompts so AI gives consistent results
          </li>
          <li>How to handle unpredictability in AI responses</li>
          <li>
            How to integrate and manage multiple real-world APIs ‚Äî Google Maps,
            Places, Speech, and SendGrid
          </li>
          <li>How to build fallback systems, retries, and protected routes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          But more than anything, I learned how to build for real people. Not
          around the limits of a system ‚Äî but around the way people think, talk,
          and dream.
